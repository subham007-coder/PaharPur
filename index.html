        <p class="content">
            We at Paharpur believe in refining people's lives and nurturing their dreams for a resilient tomorrow. 
            The primary goal of our business is way beyond counting profits by serving our customers and other communities 
            at large. Our corporate social responsibility stems from the ‘three bottom line’ concept entailing ‘People, 
            Planet and Profit’ at the core of our every activity. Paharpur's commitment to measuring social, and 
            environmental impact along with sustainability and profitable business practices are the pillars of our 
            foundation for a better tomorrow.<br><br>
            We shoulder all four categories of Corporate Social Responsibility: Environmental, Ethical, Economic, and 
            Philanthropic. This page is dedicated to our philanthropic approaches towards society.
